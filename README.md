# Translator-of-nucleotide-codes-into-amino-acids

The project designed to convert genetic information encoded in nucleotide sequences into the corresponding amino acids

This tool translates nucleotide sequences into their corresponding amino acids. It helps in decoding genetic information from DNA or RNA sequences into the building blocks of proteins, aiding in understanding gene expression and protein synthesis processes.
